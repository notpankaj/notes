npm i react-redux
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit



1. configure A store

inside src/app/store.js -->configureStore

2. make it accessable thought outThought the Application using {Provider} from 'react-redux'

inside src/index.js -->Provider

3. creating slice 
 inside features/counter/counterSlice.js 

 the slice made with {createSlice} contains a 
 name:key -> to indentify  
 initaialState -> holds the State  
 reducer -> reducers function having name as ACTION  

slice returns --> action and reducer , that can be used to manage state

4. mergeing our newly created slice's reducer with store's reducer: {}

inside src/app/store.js --> { reducer: {  counter: counterReducer }} 

5. accessing store values with useSelctor

we can access any value/state present inside store with {useSelctor} from any where  

6. modifying state using useDispatch

dispatch need an actionCreater/action inorder , which was auto generated by the slice.actions created from createSlice 

7. working with mutiReducer
  we dont need to anything ,we can just create another slice and merge that slice's reducer with store  
    ->inside store.js 
  eg,   
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
    theme: themeReducer,
  },
